Connects the land between [[Etheria]] and [[Fantasia]]. It is only active at night and there are a series of towers with shops and hotels to stay in during the day time. There is a central yellow line on the bridge the crosses from south to north. When it reaches the north side that means the bridge is going to shut down.
