Legendary underground city to the south east of [[Celestria (Country)]] in [[Valley of Frostheart]]. Contains one of the [[Horns of Malphos]]. Legend says that is has existed for thousands of years even before [[Malphos]]. It was supposedly discovered by the civilization to the south east so they could hide from [[Malphos]], however they were too late and [[Malphos]] was able to destroy them, so the entrance was lost.

It is also a location of a portal to the Fey Wild and houses an artifact to seal the demon.
