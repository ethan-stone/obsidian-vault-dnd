[[Malphos]] had 5 horns. During [[Malphos]] battle with [[Celestria (Hero)]] and being sealed, the horns were broken and scattered across the land. They are able to break the seal on [[Malphos]] if used together. Two of the horns are in possession of [[Celestria (Country)]] and reside deep underground in separate vaults far apart for safe keeping. Two are in possession of the [[Infernal Order]]. The last one is in [[Deephaven]].
