# Timeline

## Start
Players are in [[Etheria]], where there is a festival being held. As part of the festival there is a section for anyone looking to find some work, whether it's a quest or just helping in a shop. There seems to be a long line that ends in a booth containing members of the kingdom. The sign above the booth says that the kingdom is offering 100 gold per person of a search and rescue team. If the group they are searching for is dead they should bring proof. The location to search is the [[Valley of Frostheart]].

## Valley of Frostheart
The players encounter some creatures on the way down to the valley. Upon approaching the bottom, they find the knights they are searching for but it is immediately clear they are all dead. They then hear a very loud horn and the light breeze and flurries they are currently experiencing start to turn into a blizzard. Then they see a number of golems rise out of the ground but they don't attack. They are simply there for defense, so if they are attacked or the group presses forward they will become hostile. It should be made very clear that if the party fights the golems they will die unless a miracle happens.

## Return to Etheria
The players bring back proof that everyone was dead and should report of what they found. At this point it is revealed that the knights were looking for [[Deephaven]]\ and it looks like they found it. The knowledge of the [[Horns of Malphos]] is also revealed, as well as the [[Infernal Order]]. They are also told that the seal on [[Malphos]] is cracking because the [[Infernal Order]] has two stones together. The group is offered to go back to the [[Valley of Frostheart]] to find the artifact they hope is there to make the seal stronger. That artifact is the [[]] If the group deny’s it then it simply happens “of screen” by way of [[Celestria (Country)]] sending there own more powerful knights.

## Alternatives to going back to the Valley of Frostheart
If the players choose not to go back to the Valley of Frostheart there should be some other options. At any point there is a random chance that the Infernal Order appears.
- [ ] Need to come up with other location and things to do. Some ideas are.
    - A Las Vegas equivalent city or a red light district where they can play poker and get into some trouble
    - Venture to other kingdoms where they may encounter struggling villages they want to help
    - Work for the kingdom for either other search and rescues, or maybe to recover lost goods from bandits etc.
    - Maybe a coliseum like place where you can enter to fight beasts or maybe it can be groups vs groups. Capture the flag?

- Faeries are going to be somewhat uncommon in Orialis
