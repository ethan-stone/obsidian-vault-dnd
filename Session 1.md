We are in [[Etheria]]. The Solstice Festival is in full swing. I 

There is a festival and there is a big area for people looking for work.

Eli's character is in line for a swords guild he has previously done work for. While not uninterested in doing work for them again, he is actually looking for answers.

Eventually Madi's character, Luna Crowclaw, is introduced. Having skills in thievery, she is always on the lookout for an easy steal and other thieves and other mischief. She at some point notices in an ally way a beast owner tied up. The beasts are enraged, clearly looking for blood, and there is a hooded figure releasing them.
