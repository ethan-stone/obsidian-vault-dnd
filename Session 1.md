We are in [[Etheria]]. The Solstice Festival is in full swing. It is the a celebration of the Sun on the day with the most sunlight in the year. The entire central circle is PACKED with dozens of stands offering food, games and work.

# Eli's Characters Intro
Eli's character is in line for the [[Stormcloak Brigade]] which he has previously done work for. While not uninterested in doing work for them again, he is actually looking for answers. The person he speaks with is [[Ba]]

# Tieraney's Characters Intro
Tieraney's character is looking at trinkets.

# Luna Crowclaw Intro
Eventually Madi's character, Luna Crowclaw, is introduced. Having skills in thievery, she is always on the lookout for an easy steal and other thieves and other mischief. She is walking on the edge of the circle, behind all of the stands, perhaps looking for some goodies. She at some point notices in an ally way a beast owner tied up. The beasts are enraged, clearly looking for blood, and there is a hooded figure releasing them.
